## Difference between the Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

#  ***Shallow Copy*** 
* Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.   
* Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.	
* Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects.	
* Shallow copy is faster.	

#  ***Deep Copy***
* 	Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.

* Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.

* Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well.

* Deep copy is comparatively slower.
